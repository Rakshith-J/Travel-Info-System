# Travel-Info-System

Travel Info System is a simple windows application which serves as a compact travel guide to the users. The whole software is implemented as two applications - 1 at the user side (DBMS) and 1 for administrators. 

## Guide to use

### To Run
* To run the apps a local mysql database is necessary.Setup the local database based on the schema mentioned.
* Change the connection string (parameters to connect to your local database) in the code (you might have to change at many places).
* After this, just open the executable file(.exe) at bin/debug/ of respective app folders.
#### NOTE :
          If the database was hosted online this setup wouldn't be necessary. To prevent this complexity we plan to upload a dump file of the local database required which might rule rule out steps 1 and 2   

### To view/edit the code
* Open the solution file(.sln) of respective apps in visual studio (preferably 2017)
